You Donâ€™t Know JS: Up & Going: 

Chapter 1: "Intro Programming" Synopsis

An introduction to programming languages at a very high level that slowly moves towards JavaScript concepts and covers the essential programming building blocks, including operators, values & types, variables, blocks, conditionals, loops, and functions in addition to statements and expressions.

It explains what's going on internally with the JavaScript engine when it encounters variables. It breaks down the most fundamental concepts such as scope, blocks and input/output as well as not stopping at defining, but takes things a step further by defining how basic JavaScript operates. It talks about function as a clustered sequence of operation to perform a well defined action. Example: The phone store employee doesn't carry around a calculator to figure out the taxes and final purchases amount. That's a task she needs to define once and reuse over and over again. The company has a checkout register with those "functions" built in. 

Lastly, It covers the importance of code comments for readable code and stresses on the power of practice coding, the best way to learn code is to write code.
